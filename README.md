# Multispecies_Invasion
Data, functions and R script are provided for applying analyses of the article:
"Inferring the trophic attributes of new co-occurring invaders in the largest natural French lake (Lake Bourget)"  

The script **BINV-D-21-00258_Rcodes.R** is devided into three parts: (i) Inferrence and refinement of the trophic links among species in an inventory, 
(ii) Example of data analyses considering one species in analyses and (iii) Example of data analyses considering a body size gradient of a small invasive fish.  
  
  - **cv_Functions_aNM**: functions from Vagnon *et al.* (2021) for computing the prey body size range of a consumer, infering trophic links, weighting trophic links
  - **Param_reginvert/Param_regvert**: requested parameters for computing the prey body size range
  - **Example_SpInventory.Rdata**: simplified data to apply quickly the functions from the aNM
  - **DATA_Bourget.csv**: data correponding to the species inventory used in the article
